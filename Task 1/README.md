## LGMVIP Task Code: 
### Task 1 :  
### Name of Project : Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
Iris flowers classification ML project: this particular ML project is usually referred to as the "Hello World" of the ML. the iris flowers data set contains numeric attributes,
and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms,mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a smallest data set,it can easily fit in memory
without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
